Project Proposal

Analysis of volatile and non-volatile data images using computer system forensics procedures
and tools.

Priyank Jani, Will Van Wart, Weeam Alshangiti

Abstract:
Every systems forensics investigator needs to be hands-on with standard forensics procedures as
well as tools and techniques to probe cases where digital systems and resources have been
compromised by malicious intent and activity. For the education of upcoming forensics
professionals, a number of cases and raw data is available online. We hereby propose to analyze,
present findings, and make an exhaustive collection of reports on the various test cases available
online. Also, at the end of the analysis we will be briefly discussing which tools are better in
specific tasks and which ones are better for other tasks based on our experiments. The raw
images of both volatile and non-volatile nature shall be scrutinized using Linux forensics tools,
Encase and other standard libraries for both volatile as well as non-volatile data images.
